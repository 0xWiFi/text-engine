# TODO: #
 * Support looking at characters in the room. E.G. LOOK AT GASPARD.
 * Add a "block" string property to exits. If player tries to go in that direction, print the string.
 * Ending: Take off dress; go into pool; offer statue rum; gate opens behind you; THE END.
 * At some point, at IN as an exit to FOUNTAIN, blocked by "You don't want to get your dress wet."
 * Add a character to the game who the player can ask for directions. The player gives the name of a room they want to get to and the character responds with a list of directions from BFS.
